# Digit_Classification

This is a school project where I use KNN, Linear Regression with Log-Odd Transformations, Bernoulli NB to recognize images of digits. I experiment with Gridsearch tuning and Mean Blur Functions to improve model accuracy. Finally, I generate images from the model and perform model evaluation. 

See "Image Recognition System - Digit Classification.ipynb" for code, markdown explanations and visualizations.
