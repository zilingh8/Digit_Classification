# Digit_Classification

This is a school project where I classify digit images using KNN, Linear Regression (Feature Engineering with Log-Odd Transformations) and Bernoulli NB models. I experiment with Gridsearch tuning and Mean Blur Functions to improve model accuracy. Finally, I generate images from the model and perform model evaluation. 

Dataset Used : MNIST handwritten digit datase in sklearn

See "Image Recognition System - Digit Classification.ipynb" for code, markdown explanations and visualizations.
